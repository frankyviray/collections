                    <h3><b>Freight/HC - Customer: bill more expensive:</b> Well at the point of sale, Salesman didnt
                        know what the shipping was so it wasn't quoted. <b>Everything usually has shipping and handling
                            on it.</b>Here is what i can do today for you....(just give me a moment)(pause)</h3>
                    <h3>1. I can bring the Shipping and Handling down to a flate rate fee of, $_____. If i did that for
                        you, that would be treating you fair right?(Let Him Respond)</h3>
                    <h3>Okay great, i'll make the adjustments on the account.(Are you able to clear that up with a VISA,
                        MASTER, CBP?) ** I seen you paid last time with a card ending in......</h3>
                    <h3>2. If he is upset saying he wants to return because of shipping.... waive it. Well I’d hate to
                        have an upset customer over shipping, here’s what I’ll do for you today. I’m going to WAIVE the
                        shipping and Handling for you. Okay? I’’ notate the account, so everyone knows about.</h3>
                    <h3>3. (I am looking at a note on the account and the SLM did say not to charge you shipping on this
                        order, well honor that.) (I don’t know why THAT got on there)</h3>
                    <h3><b>TAXES: </b>We must charge taxes on all orders: to waive tax ask the customer for a resale
                        license,</h3>
                    <h3><b>WARRANTY REPLACEMENT BITS: </b> WARRANTY REPLACEMENT BITS okay well, what sizes do you need
                        replaced? I’ll let the SLM know and we will take care of you.</h3>
                    <h3><b>CC TRUST</b> Customer I don't trust you: hey look I know you don’t know me from Adam, but….
                        you do just your credit card company, right? And if anything happens, your credit card company
                        has your back, wouldn’t you agree?</h3>
                    <h3><b>SHORT SHIPS</b> it looks like there was a short ship on the order and the rest of its on its
                        way.</h3>
                    <h3><b>BARE TOOL</b> I am sorry to hear that, we just sent the bare tool. Its possible that when we
                        put in the order we put in the wrong item # because we do sell bare tools for customers who
                        already have the battery’s. I will let the SLM know about it and we will take care of you. Is
                        this the best # to reach you at?</h3>
                    <h2><b>Sir I’m not trying to pressure you, but read me the card 4 digits at a time</b></h2>
                    <h3><b>UNAUTHORIZED CHARGE: </b>You do have the merchandise out, there right? Someone must of told
                        us to run the card down there… We consider this matter closed and we can’t do anything about it
                        since you have the merchandise out there?</h3>
