                                We have still not received the merchandise back and I noticed that the label is not in use. We can settle the account
                                today for (P/A amount). Otherwise, I need you to use the label we sent within (3) business days of receiving this email.
                                If there is no resolution or contact with you we will be forced to send this account to a 3rd party collections agency.
                                It is very important that you get back to us immediately to avoid any further action against you or your company.</p>
